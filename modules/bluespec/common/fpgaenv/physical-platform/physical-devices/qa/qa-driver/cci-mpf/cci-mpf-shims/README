Memory Properties Factory (MPF) is a set of shims that each provide a memory
function.  Functions include virtual to physical translation (VTP),
load/store ordering, etc.  Each shim takes both consumes and produces an AFU
interface.  The factory composes a memory subsystem with the desired
characteristics by combining the appropriate shims.
