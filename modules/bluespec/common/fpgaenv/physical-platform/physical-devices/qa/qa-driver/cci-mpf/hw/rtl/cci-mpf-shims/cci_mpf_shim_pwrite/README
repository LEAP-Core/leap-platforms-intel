Partial write emulation shim.

CCI does not provide an interface for updating a part of a line by merging new
data with existing data.  The partial write shim generates a read-modify-write
sequence using a mask to update specific bytes within a line.  When coupled
with the WRO shim, the state of the line is protected on the FPGA side during
the operation.  However, the line is not locked and writes from the CPU to
a location in the middle of a partial write sequence may be corrupted.

Partial writes are controlled by the MPF pwrite c1 extension header.
