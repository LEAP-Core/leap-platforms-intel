Intel QuickAssist Physical Platform debugger.

A very slow debugging channel is available through the QA driver using the
SREG interface defined in our driver.  SREG is implemented using a QA CSR
to trigger a register read request.  Responses to read requests are written
to shared memory and consumed by the ReadSREG() method in our host-side
driver.  The mechanism is hidden to the user.  All the user sees are
SREG read request and response methods.  There is no latency requirement
between arrival of the request and generation of the response, though the
host driver blocks until a response is received.

The debugger here implements a history ring buffer.  SREG 0 is the most
recently written entry.  An optional soft connection is exposed, allowing
one module to connect and record state.
