The driver connects to the wires from the QuickAssist cache coherent interface
CCI).  The driver exports a pair of FIFOs, one from the FPGA to the host and
the other from the host to the FPGA.


CSRs:

The following CSRs control the driver:

  DSM_BASE -
    Base of the shared memory area used as to hold status written by the FPGA.
    As required by the CCI specification, the FPGA-side driver writes the AFU
    ID to DSM line0.

  EN --
    Writing one enables the driver.

  READ_FRAME_BASE -
    64 bit physical address of the host to FPGA FIFO data.

  WRITE_FRAME_BASE --
    64 bit physical address of the FPGA to host FIFO data.

  TRIGGER_DEBUG --
    FPGA-side driver modules may monitor the TRIGGER_DEBUG register.  They may
    construct a memory-line worth of debugging state that is written by
    qa_drv_status_writer to DSM address 0.  The value of TRIGGER_DEBUG
    determines which line is written.  The mapping of TRIGGER_DEBUG values to
    debugging state is in the code that sets debug_rsp in qa_drv_status_writer.

  ENABLE_TEST --
    Start read, write and loopback driver tests that are implemented in
    qa_drv_tester.  Bits [1:0] of the ENABLE_TEST CSR write select the test:

      1 - SINK:
        Host sends a stream of data through the host to FPGA FIFO which is consumed but dropped by the
        tester.  The test ends when the low bit of a data packet is 1.
      2 - SOURCE:
        FPGA sends a stream of data through the FPGA to host channel.  The number
        of messages to send is controlled by bits [31:2] of the ENABLE_TEST
        CSR message.  The low bit of the last message sent to the host is 1.
      3 - LOOPBACK:
        All messages arriving in the host to FPGA FIFO are reflected back through
        the FPGA to host channel.  The test ends when the low bit of a message
        is 1.
