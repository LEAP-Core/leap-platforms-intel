Verilog Stage

This stage invokes verilog simulator compilation. Invocation is done through
the Bluespec compiler so selection of particular verilog simulator (iverilog,
vcs, etc) may be done through environment variables.

The Intel QuickAssist simulator is the top level of the compilation.  The
Verilog module in this directory instantiates a QA emulator which then
instantiates the rest of the system.

The compliation is mostly generic for vcs but has some special handling for
adding the Intel simulation environment from a shared installation using
the AAL_QA_ASE environment variable.
