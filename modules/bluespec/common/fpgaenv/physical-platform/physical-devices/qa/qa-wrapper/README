The Intel QuickAssist (QA) driver.

QA instantiates an accelerator by constructing a cci_std_afu().  The LEAP
version is provided here.  LEAP's cci_std_afu() passes the wires to the
usual mk_model_Wrapper method.

LEAP's QA platform and driver expose all the QA wires in mk_model_Wrapper.
The wires are passed down to the clock generator and to the QA driver,
which implements the LEAP physical channel and CCI memory interfaces.
