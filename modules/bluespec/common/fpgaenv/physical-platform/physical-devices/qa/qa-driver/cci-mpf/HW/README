MPF -- Memory Properties Factory

The raw Xeon+FPGA CCI (Cache Coherent Interface) exposes a primitive connection
to memory.  Addresses are physical and, except for write fence, no completion
order guarantees are provided.

MPF is a collection of CCI to CCI shims, each adding a feature to the resulting
interface.  Shims can be composed to generate memory interfaces with properties
required for a particular application.  Shims include:

* VTP - Virtual to Physical translation

* WRO - Write/Read Order: guarantee write/write and write/read order within
  a cache line

* Read response sorting


cci_mpf.sv is provided as a standard wrapper for building typical
configurations.  Module cci_mpf is configurable with parameters that control
instantiation of shims.

MPF is broken into several directories, each with a README file:

* cci-if: Packages and functions that describe and operate on CCI.

* cci-mpf-if: An extension of cci-if with extra state required to control
    the behavior of shims.  For example, the CCI-MPF interface adds a bit
    to indicate whether a memory request's address is virtual or physical.
    The README file in cci-mpf-if describes the differences between CCI
    and CCI-MPF.

* cci-mpf-shims: Shim implementations.

* cci-mpf-prims: A collection of primitive modules used by the shims.


See cci-mpf-if/NOTES for information in instantiating MPF in a design.
