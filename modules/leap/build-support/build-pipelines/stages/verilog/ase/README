Verilog Stage

This stage invokes verilog simulator compilation. Invocation is done through
the Bluespec compiler so selection of particular verilog simulator (iverilog,
vcs, etc) may be done through environment variables.

The compliation is mostly generic for vcs but has some special handling for
the Intel AFU simulation environment (ASE).
